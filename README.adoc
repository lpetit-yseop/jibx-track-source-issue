== Usage

=== Demonstrating the Issue with java 7 (or 8) and jibx 1.3.1

----
mvn clean test
----

The Unit test assertion fails (the class of the unmarshalled data does not implement implement `ITrackSource`, but it should)

=== Demonstrating the lack of Issue with java 6 and jibx 1.2.5

----
mvn -f pom-java6.xml clean test
----

With Java 6, jibx 1.2.5, the Unit test assertion succeeds.

Jibx 1.2.5 + Java 6 is the last known official combo for which `track-source` support is known to work.


An easy way to test with java 6 is to start the project inside a docker container:

----
$ cd jibx-track-source-issue
$ docker run -ti -v `pwd`:/jibx --name docker-java6-maven jamesdbloom/docker-java6-maven
[inside docker]$ cd /jibx
[inside docker]$ mvn -f pom-java6.xml clean test
----
